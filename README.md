# NUEDC2019_D

Part of the code of our work for NUEDC. [NUEDC](https://www.nuedc-training.com.cn/) is a very prestigious electronics skills competition in China. Our work was an attempt to measure the characteristics of a basic amplifier circuit and to further determine the exact cause of a circuit failure if certain components have been removed or damaged (more details of the requirements in the [problem sheet (in Chinese)](https://github.com/cruelkiddy/NUEDC2019_D/blob/master/D%E9%A2%98_%E7%AE%80%E6%98%93%E7%94%B5%E8%B7%AF%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95%E4%BB%AA.pdf).

Our design won the National 2nd prize and 1st prize in the Beijing Arena. The project was completed in 3 days by our team of three. The team members were: [Yongxiang](https://github.com/BNUGYX), [Jie](https://github.com/llvdou), and me. The uploaded code is part of my work focused on embedded development. Yongxiang was in charge of the hardware design and Jie worked on both the hardware and embedded development.
